# Thread

I am tired of everyone retweeting seventeen-tweet tirades mansplaining about why the president is a bad person.

If at this point in time, you don't think the president is a bad person, then it's unlikely anything will convince you otherwise until it's too late. Why are you even bothering?

If at this point in time, you think the president is a bad person, do you really feel like reading another seventeen tweets about some other white guy with a degree confirming your own opinion is doing anything productive?
