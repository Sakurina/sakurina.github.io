Tonight, I realized 30 minutes before midnight that I didnâ€™t have a post ready, so here's a quick media recommendation before I turn into a pumpkin.

Friend from the VJ Army days Toph has become quite a big deal in the Smash Bros. scene over the years, and he has a new show out on Cross Counter called *The Reads* where he, Bobby Scar, and a rotating guest play Melee on netplay and try to climb the ranks every week. It's kinda like *Excellent Adventures* but with Melee, and while I know nothing about competitive Melee, it has been very entertaining. Episodes come out every Sunday, and two of them have been released so far.
