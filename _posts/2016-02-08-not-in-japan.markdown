# Way Away

This February is the first time since 2012 I will have spent a February on Canadian soil.

One of the luxuries of being self-employed was the freedom to just check out for a month and a half to two months every winter and spend that time hanging out with friends in Japan. Over the years, I've made many friends over there, and it was really nice to be able to check in with them on a regular basis.

This year, I can't do that, and it certainly feels weird. It's also unclear when my contract will truly end, so it's not like I can plan my return that far in advance. I feel more out of touch with my friends overseas than ever; not only do I not get to see them in person for more time than I would have hoped, but having to work Regular Eastern Time Working Hours means the time I get to spend with them on Twitter and LINE while they're awake is much more limited.

I miss my friends and the city of Yokohama, which has been my home away from home for almost six months over several visits now. I hope to see them both again sometime this year.
