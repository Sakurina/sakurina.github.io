# Fishvapour

[Fishvapour](https://bandcamp.com/tag/fishvapour?sort_field=date) is not exactly new, but it's new to me. Fishvapour is a subgenre of vaporwave focused on capturing an aquatic, underwater sound. The most prominent artist in the genre is [Kai Beckman](https://kaibeckman.bandcamp.com), who also goes under the pen name [s a k i å¤¢](https://sakidream.bandcamp.com), and is responsible for running [Tetra Systems](https://tetrasystems.bandcamp.com), his own fishvapour label.

I've been a bit burnt out on vaporwave recently, but fishvapour is reeling me back in.
