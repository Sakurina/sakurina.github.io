# A Podcast Recommendation

While I can say that the increasing influence of public radio on the direction podcasting is heading into is worrisome, public radio pumps out a lot of interesting and high quality programming via podcasts. I'd like to recommend everyone check out [Invisibilia][inv] from NPR. Invisibilia is a podcast about the invisible aspects of human behaviour and emotion. Season two started a few weeks ago and they have absolutely been killing it, particularly with the last two episodes on the influence of environment on mental illness and frames of reference. (For what it's worth, season one was also really good and worth a listen.)

Very rarely does a podcast leave an impression on you that makes you keep reflecting on it throughout the week, but this is definitely one of them.
